# Interactive Car Simulation
An kinematic car simulation that interactively defines the starting position, ending position, and forward direction for the car's trajectory.

## Key Features:
- **User-Friendly UI:** The simulation boasts an intuitive interactive user interface, allowing users to specify the starting and ending positions, along with the desired direction for the car's trajectory.

- **Trajectory Generation:** Leveraging user input through the UI, the simulation generates a precise trajectory for the car.

- **Physics-Based Model:** The car simulation utilizes a kinematic model, guaranteeing a realistic representation of motion.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Dynamic Model:** Future updates will introduce advanced features, including slip conditions and maximum steering angle saturation, to enhance the simulation's realism and accuracy.

- **Control Systems:** Upcoming versions will incorporate advanced control features, further refining the simulation accuracy and providing a more comprehensive experience.
